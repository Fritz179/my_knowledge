\subsection{Equations}

Indeterminate \& coefficients
$\frac{1}{x}, 2^n$ are not polynomials

Grundmenge: $\mathbb{G}$ \\
Function domain, Defintionsmenge: $\mathbb{D}$ \\
Solution set, LÃ¶sungsmege: $\mathbb{L}$ \\
\\
From the function domain we remove where the denominator is 0 or the radicand negative is
\\
Taking a root loses solutions $x^2 = 4$ because $x = 2$ loses $x = -2$ \\
For the same reason exponentiation adds solutions

Inequality invert > to < if multiplied/divided by negative numbers

For roots and absolute divide equation in positive and negative side

where $>$ becomes $<$ and for x $<$ $=>$ and, x $>$ $=>$ or

x = x 
0 = 1
